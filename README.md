# AI-Gym-Trainer

# ABOUT

Utilized Python, OpenCV, Mediapipe, Numpy

This program allows users to work out efficiently. This is done through the rendering of a live web-cam. Through the captured real-time video, joint detections are made and a counter begings (reps). However, a rep is only granted when the motion is done properly and with full range. I myself strugle with ego-lifting (lifting heavy weights but with improper form) and so I decided to create this app to benefit myself as well as others who are facing the same obstacle.

# Future Plans

I intend to extend the functionality of this app, so that one can keep track of every workout they had in detail, as well as include more exercies detections and a UI for easier interactions.

# Installation

1- git clone the repo <br>
2- pip install opencv-python <br>
3- pip install mediapipe (Python 3.7.0 needed) <br>
4- Enjoy your workout! <br>
