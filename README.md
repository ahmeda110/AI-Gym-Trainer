# AI-Gym-Trainer

# ABOUT

Utilized Python, OpenCV, Mediapipe, Numpy

This program allows users to work out efficiently. This is done through the rendering of a live web-cam. Throgh the captured video, joint detections can be made and a counter begings for counting reps. However, a rep is only granted when the motion is done properly and with full range. I myself strugle with ego-lifting (lifting heavy weights but with improper form) and so I decided to create this app to benefit myself as well as others who are facing the same obstacle.

# Future Plans

I intend to exted the functionality of this app, so that one can keep track of every workout they had in detail, as well as include more exercie detections and a UI for easier interactions.

# Instalation

1- git clone the repo
2- pip install opencv-python
3- pip install mediapipe (Python 3.7.0 needed)
4- Enjoy your workout!
